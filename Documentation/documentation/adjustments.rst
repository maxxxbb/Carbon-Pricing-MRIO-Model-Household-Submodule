Adjustments (MINDSET)
*********************

In its current version MINDSET models households demand reaction to tax-induced price changes of consumer goods with USDA-based own- and cross price elasticities of demand (estimated in Muhammad et al. 2011) for one representative household.  
Since a countries aggregate demand adjustment in response to price shocks depends both on the distribution of total expenditures and differing substitution opportunities across the income/expenditure spectrum, 
we can make use of pre-harmonized Microdata containing information on decile- and country specific expenditure patterns and (own)-price elasticities of demand.
